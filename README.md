# Linked-List
It is a repository which contains several linked list. It can be single, double, circular linked list. I have coded all the codes in C++ and made it executable.

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.

I have used new and delete keywords and designed it dynamically so that it will avoid data misuse.
